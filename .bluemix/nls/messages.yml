template.name: "Create toolchain: Marbles sample for IBM Blockchain"
template.description: "\n This toolchain will deploy the Marbles sample application into your IBM Blockchain Platform network. \n\n The sample is published to GitHub, so the toolchain starts by creating your own clone of the code. This is connected to a Delivery Pipeline, which handles continuous integration: if you update the code in your GitHub Repo, the Deployment Pipeline will detect it and deploy that code to your IBM Blockchain Platform instance.\n\n You’ll use IBM Blockchain Platform to see your running code and to launch the “Marbles app”, a front-end application you can use to interact with the blockchain chain code. \n\n **You do not need to change any of the options**, though you may tweak configurations if you need to. You may need to authorize IBM Cloud with your Github account before you can create the toolchain."
template.gettingStarted: "Your toolchain is ready! A new build of Marbles is underway. **Click the \"Delivery Pipeline\" tile below to see the build's status.** Then once it's done click the **Marbles** tile below."
